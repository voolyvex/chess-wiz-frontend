          <h1>What is a PGN?</h1>
        </div>
        <p id="about-about">
          ChessWiz uses the Portable Game Notation (PGN) format for representing
          chess games and moves. PGN is a standard way of recording chess games
          in plain text, and it allows users to easily share, analyze, and
          review games. In PGN, each move is represented by a unique code that
          includes the piece moved, the starting and ending squares, and any
          additional information such as captures or promotions. ChessWiz also
          supports variations, annotations, and other PGN features, making it a
          versatile tool for both learning and analyzing chess games.
